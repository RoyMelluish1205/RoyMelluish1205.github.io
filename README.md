    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>My name is Roy Melluish!</p>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Roy Melluish. I am currently a sophomore student at the University of Notre Dame, with a major in Computer Science and a supplemental major in ACMS. Before going to Notre Dame, I grew up in southern Michigan. I am personally very new to programming, but I have always been passionate about problem solving and finding a deeper understanding of how the world around me works. I believe that in the constantly progressing landscape that our world is in, understanding technology is vital and something I find great interest in pursuing. Outside of academics, I love playing video games, making music, and playing tennis. Thank you and enjoy my website!</p>
